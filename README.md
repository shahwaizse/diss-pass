kvm is amazing and using it I plan on making an ultimate 3-in-1 operating system in which I can develop programs, play games at near-native performance, and do all other computer stuff. 
the base layer will be Manjaro because it's based on Arch and all Arch packages work on it and the AUR is awesome. 
the Windows layer will be a Windows 10 Pro VM with GPU Passthrough so I can play all my games without worrying about compatibility. 
and an extra MacOS High Sierra layer just for the memes

After much research this just isn't viable until I have atleast a 1tb nvme ssd and a really REALLY fast cpu with atleast 16 threads. 
so this project is on hold until I get a super cool rig with high end components. 
motivation to put in effort so that I can achieve my dreams++
